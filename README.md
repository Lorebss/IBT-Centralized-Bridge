# IBT-Centralized-Bridge
Blockchain Technology Final Project- A simple centralized bridge built as a final project for Introduction to Blockchain. The project connects a local Ethereum blockchain and a local Sui network, allowing users to transfer IBT tokens between chains by burning tokens on the source chain and minting them on the destination chain via a relayer.
